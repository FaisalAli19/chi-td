## CHI: Collective Human Intelligence

Building blocks for education that supports the creation of an online course and connects learners with creators and other peers, better through AI.

## How It Works

### Easy, like lego blocks.

Creation of course on CHI is just dragging one feature over another, from a dozen handpicked features.

### Collaboration that works.

Learning happens when it is shared. That's why we have created CHI in a way the collaboration just works.

### Analytics and AI-Driven.

Analytics and AI help you to make better decisions at CHI, whether it is in the creation of course or learning a new one.

### Open, yet secure.

The platform is open source, but we take privacy very seriously. None of your data is leaked or used to serve ads.
