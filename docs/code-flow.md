The CHI application uses Mongo, Express, Backbone (MarionetteJs-The Backbone Framework) and Node for simple and scalable fullstack js applications.

- **MongoDB** : Document database – used by your back-end application to store its data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents
- **Express** (sometimes referred to as Express.js): Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js
- **Marionette** : Marionette simplifies your Backbone application code with robust views and architecture solutions.
- **Node.js** : JavaScript runtime environment – lets you implement your application back-end in JavaScript
